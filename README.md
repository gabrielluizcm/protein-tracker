# Protein Tracker
Simple protein tracker app to help me count my daily proteins and I need some project to get motived to start coding for fun/study again.

The are many existing applications for this purpose but for me there were too many details and steps just to track daily protein grams, so I reduced it to a couple buttons, ~~although now I need to know the proteins on my food before hand ðŸ˜…~~ *(I may implement some kind of *'protein library'* in the future)*.

## Tech info
The project is built with **React+Vite+Typescript** and can be run by cloning the repo locally and executing `npm i` inside the directory, followed by `npm run dev` *(or the equilavent for your JS package manager of choice*).
